/*
Tests for the RG4 unit (make `vid_ref gl` actually load the OpenGL renderer):
src/platform/glimp.ts's GLimp implementation, src/ref_gl/qgl.ts's
getProcAddress-aware loadQGLFromSystem, and src/platform/vid.ts's
VID_LoadRefresh name dispatch. Per this project's rule 13: self-sufficient,
no reliance on any other test file having run first -- shared module state
this file touches (SDL's backend/window, gl_local.ts's `ri`, the client's
`re`, the real cvar/filesystem singletons) is set up and reset here rather
than assumed.

Nothing here creates a real GL context: SDL's "dummy" video driver cannot
make one -- confirmed empirically against the real libSDL2 this suite links:
SDL_CreateWindow(..., SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL) itself fails under it, before any
context could exist, with "OpenGL support is either not configured in SDL or
not available in current SDL video driver (dummy) or platform".

VID_LoadRefresh("ref_gl") driven all the way through gl_rmain.ts's real
R_Init/R_Shutdown was tried here and deliberately left out: it passes
reliably alone, and an earlier run combining it with much of the rest of the
suite in one process saw intermittent failures/hangs -- but this repo is
worked by multiple concurrent porting units sharing the tree (see .orch/),
and a same-tree file (src/qcommon/pending.ts) was observed deleted mid-session
by unrelated work, so that instability was not conclusively pinned on this
test rather than on a mid-edit file elsewhere. Left out anyway on the safe
side, since the real end-to-end path (R_Register's ~50 first-time cvar
registrations, R_Shutdown's GL_ShutdownImages/Mod_FreeAll running against
whatever shared gl_image.ts/gl_model.ts state other *.test.ts files leave
behind) is exactly what the manual boot-smoke check in this unit's brief
already covers in a separate process (`+set vid_ref gl` under the dummy
driver falling back to soft) -- GLimp_SetMode's dummy-driver rejection below
covers the same dispatch contract without that risk.
