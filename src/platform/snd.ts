// One portable implementation of snd_loc.h's "SYSTEM SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS"
// (SNDDMA_Init/SNDDMA_GetDMAPos/SNDDMA_Shutdown/SNDDMA_BeginPainting/
// SNDDMA_Submit), matching PORTING.md's platform mapping: the linux/win32/
// irix per-OS backends are alternative implementations of this same
// interface and are not transliterated file-by-file.
//
// Two drivers live behind that interface here:
//
// - SDL (sdl.ts), when the client path armed the backend and the system
//   library opened. `dma.buffer` stays the ring buffer snd_mix.ts's
//   S_PaintChannels/S_TransferPaintBuffer write PCM into, exactly as
//   DirectSound's secondary buffer is in win32/snd_win.c; SNDDMA_Submit
//   pushes the newly painted span into SDL's audio queue, and
//   SNDDMA_GetDMAPos reports how much of everything ever pushed the device
//   has actually consumed, which is what DirectSound's play cursor
//   (IDirectSoundBuffer_GetCurrentPosition in SNDDMA_GetDMAPos) reports
//   there. No SDL audio callback is installed, so nothing in the mixer runs
//   off the main thread.
//
// - A NULL driver, when there is no SDL device (dedicated server, missing
//   library, no audio device). Nothing is audible; SNDDMA_GetDMAPos reports
//   a simulated "playback" position that advances with wall-clock time (as
//   if a device were draining the ring at `dma.speed` samples/sec) so the
//   mixer's mix-ahead pacing (S_Update_'s GetSoundtime/endtime math in
//   snd_dma.ts) behaves the same as it would against real hardware.
//
// Field values are modeled on win32/snd_win.c's SNDDMA_InitWav (the most
// fully-specified backend, and the one that reads the `s_khz` cvar
// directly) rather than any single literal port: dma.channels=2,
// dma.samplebits=16, and dma.speed selected from `s_khz` (44/22/other ->
// 44100/22050/11025). Unlike win32's SNDDMA_InitWav (which has a real bug:
// its second `if (s_khz->value == 22)` is followed by an unconditional
// `else dma.speed = 11025`, so s_khz==44 is silently overridden back to
// 11025), this implementation picks the rate correctly -- this file has no
// single C original to be bug-for-bug faithful to (PORTING.md: the per-OS
// dirs are "not transliterated"), so the bug is not reproduced.
